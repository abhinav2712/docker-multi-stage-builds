## The Standard Single-Stage Approach
Explore the traditional approach to Dockerizing Golang applications, starting with a base image that includes the Go runtime and build tools. Understand the drawbacks of this approach, including larger image sizes and potential security concerns.

## The Multi-Stage Method
Learn how multi-stage builds address the shortcomings of single-stage builds. Dive into the two-stage process: the builder stage, where Golang programs are compiled using a specialized image, and the final step, where a minimal base image is used to create a smaller and more secure runtime image.

## Practical Comparison
Discover why Golang is an ideal candidate for demonstrating the benefits of multi-stage Docker builds. Compare the image size reduction achieved through multi-stage builds with the traditional approach, highlighting the substantial reduction in image size.
